# Synther

Simple and (hope to be) fun sound synthesizer played with your keyboard on your command line interface.
Based on the video series of [One Lone Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgamhuQnOkM).

### Install

On your prefered repositories folder, and your command line interface, type:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chum4k3r/synther.git synther
```

Then:

```
pip install -e synther
```

If everything goes fine, proceed to running the module.

### Running

Then just run the module with your Python interpreter:

```
python -m synther
```

Enjoy!
